<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>   
        HTML is short for <b>H</b>yper<b>t</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. It is a computer language devised to allow website creation. HTML consists of tags
        typed into a file. The image to the right shows the basic structure of an HTML page. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is a brief history lesson of HTML: HTML was created in the early 1990's by a man named Tim Berners-Lee. Since then, it has evolved from
        a simple language of with a small number of tags to a complex system of mark-up which enables authors to create web pages complete with animation and 
        so much more.
    </p>
    <br>
    
<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>
        CSS is short for <b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle <b>S</b>heet. CSS is used to change how HTML elements are displayed. It adds style to the webpage. One huge 
        purpose CSS serves is to add <span id="example">color</span> in a webpage.
       
        <br>
        CSS is pretty interesting. There is many different things that you can add or include For example, look at that box below.
    </p>
        <div class="showbox slideright">HOVER OVER ME</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    Isn't that cool!? That was made mostly out of CSS. Just imagine the possibilites for websites!
    </p>
    
<h2>How do tags work?</h2>
    <p>
        Tags are hidden keywords that are used to help put content onto a webpage. Typically, a tag starts with a "less than sign" and ends with a "greater than sign".
        Tags usually have two parts, an opening part and a closing part. Here is an example of one (no spaces are supposed to be added at the ends of the tag,
        this was just for demonstration):
       <br>
        < p >This is a paragraph tag < /p >
    </p>
    
<h2>What are attributes?</h2>
    <p>
        HTML elements have attributes. Attributes provide information about an element. They are always specified in the start tag. When adding an image in a
        webpage, you might use the width attribute to control how wide the picture is going to be.
    </p>
    
<h2>Lets look at some Tags</h2>
    <p>
    Here is a list of some tags commonly used in HTML:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>"p"-</b>This tag is used to create a paragraph.</li>
        <li><b>"h1"-</b>This tag is used to create a heading 1.(There are 6 headings h1-h6).</li>
        <li><b>"ul" and "li"-</b>These tags, when used together, create a list. Ul means unordered list and li is used to create the bullet points.</li>
        <li><b>"br"-</b>This tag is used to add breaks in between portions of text.</li>
    </ul>
