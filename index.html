    <h2>Introduction to the Class</h2>
        <p>
            This class, <b>Introduction to Computer Science</b>, teaches the students to use code and do many other things involving computers. 
            It teaches people about CSS, HTML, and Javascript. The students also learn much more about computers and computer related things, 
            such as making this website, creating a "bot", and using javascript to perform different purposes such as making a calculator work 
            or being used in a game.
        </p>
  
    <h2>Purpose of the Class</h2>
    <p>
        From the time computers have been created, they have been becoming more and more important in our everyday lives. 
        Because they are becoming more and more important, it is something that would be useful to us. In this class, we learn how to use HTML 
        and CSS to create websites. We also learn how to use basic JavaScript to creaet things such as our own games, which, depending on 
        how we think of the class, could be very useful.
    </p>
  
        
    <h2>Webpage Overview</h2>
    <p>
        On this website, you can learn a little more about what HTML and CSS are and the different hardware components of a computer. You can also
        learn a little more about myself. There are also pages of this site that uses JavaScript. There is a calculator, a to-do list, a 
        page that gives a few fun facts about sports, and a little Text-Based Game. You can also learn more about Vindinium and the 
        JavaScript I created in order to dominate the game.
