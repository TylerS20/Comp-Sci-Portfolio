    <h2>What is Vindinium?</h2>
    <p>Vindinium is a game that is played where the users code their own bots to play against three other bots created by different people.
    The users take control over their bots by using a programming language of their choice. Since I knew basic JS, I created my bot 
    using javascript. In the game, players are tasked with locating mines and trying to get more gold than the other three players. Each bot 
    has a limited health, where if one loses all their health, they die and lose all of the mines they have in possession. Players can die due to 
    other players attacking or the goblins attacking when you claima  mine. To prevent death,players can code their bot to go to a tavern and 
    restore 50 health points for a low cost of 2 gold. This game is played in turns. Each player goes around and does an action for each of their 
    turns, for example, going to a tavern, finding a free mine, or attacking a player. Depending on the where the game is played (public server 
    or private), the number of turns differs. On the private server where my games were played, there were a total of 1200 turns for the four 
    players (300 turns each).

    In the picture above, the beer bottles represent the taverns, the mining carts with green characters above them are the mines and goblins,
    and the heroes/bots are represented with the different colored characters (green, red, blue, or yellow).</p>

    <h2>Explanation of My Code</h2>
    <p>In the code, most, if not all of the purposes of each function, variable, if/else statement, or for loops is briefly described. Each
    description is set off by a double //. 
    <br>
    I will describe three functions of the bot and how it works.
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Find Free Mines: The first thing that this bot does is find free mines. In the "This code determines WHAT to do it" section, the bot
            may be given the task "freemines". It will be given this task under the certain circumstances that were given in the if/else 
            statements. If it is given the task "freemines", it will run a for loop located in the "This code determines HOW to do it" section.
            The code starts off saying "if(task === freemines)" which states that if the task is set to "freemines" then to run the code inside
            the if statement. The next piece of code is "var closestMine = bot.freeMines[0]". This is taking data from the game about which
            mines are free and sets it as "closestMine". Following that code is a for loop that uses the global data to figure out which mine is
            the closest. Once all of that is run, the bot is set to go to the closest free mine and claim it while putting in the console that it 
            is "Claiming a Free Mine!"
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Go to tavern: The bot has to determine whether it should go to a tavern or perform a different action. In the "What to Do" section,
            there is an if statement that takes global data about my bot's life saying that if it is below 40, then the bot's task will be set
            to "tavern" which tells the bot to go to the taverns. In the "How to do it" section, there is an if statement saying that if the
            task is equal to "tavern" then it will run the code inside. The code inside takes an array containing all of the positions of the 
            taverns and goes through each one and determines which tavern is closest to my bot. When it has found the closest tavern, it will
            set my bot's direction to that tavern so that it can heal.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Attack other bots: This code determines that when my bot has enough health, and not all the mines, it will attack gthe bot with more
            mines than me In the "WHAT to do" section, there is an if/else statement that tells the bot what to do. "else if(minesBotOne >= 
            minesBotTwo && minesBotOne >= minesBotThree && minesBotOne >= minesBotFour)" takes data from the 'Global Data" section and looks to 
            see that if bot one has more than or equal to the number of mines of each of the other bots, then to run the if/else statement inside.
            The if/else statement that is inside tells the bot which task to do. If my bot's id is equal to the bot with the most mines (or in 
            simpler terms, if I have the most mines), then the bot will run the task "freemines". If my bot's id is not equal to that of the bot 
            with the most mines, then my bot's task is to attack the bot that has the most, in this case Bot 1. In the "How to do it" section, 
            it shows that if my task is set to "attack1" or attack bot 1, then it will display in the console that it is "Attacking Bot 1" and 
            will take the position of the particular bot from the global data and set it as my bot's direction so that it is able to attack.
        </li>
    </ol></p>

    <br>
    
    <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
    <p>In the end, my bot did exactly what I wanted it to do. I was able to create it so the bot was able to attack the player who had the most
    mines until I am the character that possesses the most. After I have more mines than everybody else, the bot waits and health as needed 
    it. While it seemed complicated to do at first, the coding itself is actually fairly simple. The bot is programmed to look for how many
    mines each bot has and if a bot has more than mine, my bot will attack it. After doing this activity, I was able to understand AI a little
    more easily because I understand how the computer reads the code and follows the actions according to what it reads in the JS. I now find
    AI to be very interesting and it was cool to learn a little bit about it this interval.</p>
