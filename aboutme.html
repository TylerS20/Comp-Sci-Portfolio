<h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is Tyler Sheppy and I created this website using my knowledge of coding that I have aquired from my expedition class, Intro to Computer Science. I am a 10th grader and I attend Summit Prep.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>My favorite hobby is playing Ice Hockey. I started playing hockey when I was 6, but I've loved the sport since I was born. This is my favorite hobby because it keeps me active and I find it very <em>fun</em> and <em>exciting</em>. 
       I was brought into this sport when I was very young because my family is a hockey family. I grew up with it being a big part of my life and I love the sport greatly. I love how the sport has affected my life. While it is just
       a sport, it also strengthened some qualities in my life. These qualities include athleticism, teamwork, persistence, leadership, and so much more.</p>
