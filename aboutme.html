<h2>Hobbies</h2>
    
    <p>
       My favorite hobby is playing Ice Hockey. I started playing hockey when I was 6, but I've loved the sport since I was born. This is my 
       favorite hobby because it keeps me active and I find it very <em>fun</em> and <em>exciting</em>. I was introduced to this sport when I was 
       very young because my family is a hockey family. I grew up with it being a big part of my life and I love the sport greatly. I love how the
       sport has affected my life. While it is just a sport, it also strengthened some qualities in my life. These qualities include athleticism, 
       teamwork, persistence, leadership, and so much more. In the image to the right, you can see a picture of me when I was younger playing Ice
       Hockey.
